# WakieWakie

A dating app that aims to match people nearby based on the time they wake up. The goal of this app is to foster a much deeper connection between matches, and increase the time surface that they can interact by matching them by their sleep schedules.

## Setup

**Prerequisites**

- [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) This is the package manager used in this project, additionally the `workspaces` feature is used extensively in this project, so this becomes a must.
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) This is used as the database.
- [`Redis`](https://redis.io/) (Optional) This is only used if you intend to try out using Redis for the session storage. But why?

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go into the directory using `cd WakieWakie`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `yarn`.
4. Create an empty database in `PostgreSQL`. This will be used later on for migrations, make sure to use the name of this database for the `server/.env` config.
5. Configure the necessary environment variables on your local machine, check the [ENV](#env) section. At a minimum, you only need to configure the following environment variables in `server/.env` to be able to run the application locally.

```bash
# Database Configurations
DB_USERNAME = postgres          # Database Username for Postgres (default: "postgres")
DB_PASSWORD = postgres          # Password for Postgres          (default: "")
DB_HOSTNAME = localhost         # Hostname for Postgres          (default: "localhost")
DB_DATABASE = wakiewakie        # Database name for Postgres
DB_PORT     = 5432              # Postgres running port          (default: 5432)
```

6. Run the migrations on the database using `yarn db:migrate`.
7. Run the app locally using `yarn dev`.
   > This runs the client at `http://localhost:5173`, and the server at `http://localhost:4000`.
8. Open the web app on your desired browser using the URL above.
   > If you want to test out the server via the `Apollo GraphQL Explorer`, you can head over to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`. Make sure to enable the [cookies setting](https://community.apollographql.com/t/allow-cookies-to-be-sent-alongside-request/920/7).

## ENV

These are the avaialabe environment variables that are configurable for this application. You can check the `.env.example` on the respective machines for a quick breakdown of the environment variables.

> Note: All values are inferred as strings, and are parsed appropriately in the application. For example `Port` is a string value of 4000, it is parsed to its number counterpart in the application.

## Deployment

This application has been deployed over at [Vercel](https://wakiewakie.vercel.app/). However, do note that `Real-Time Communication` and `Notifications` do not work on the deployed application. This is due to the [limitations of Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#websockets), wherein they do not support their `Serverless Functions` to act like a [WebSocket Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). This means that you can only test out those functions by refreshing the page forcibly.
