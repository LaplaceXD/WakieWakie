# WakieWakie

A dating app that aims to match people nearby based on the time they wake up. The goal of this app is to foster a much deeper connection between matches, and increase the time surface that they can interact by matching them by their sleep schedules.

## Setup

**Prerequisites**

- [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) This is the package manager used in this project, additionally the `workspaces` feature is used extensively in this project, so this becomes a must.
- [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) This is used as the database.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go into the directory using `cd WakieWakie`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `yarn`.
4. Ensure that the necessary environment variables are configured on your local machine, check the [ENV](#env) section.
5. Run the migrations on the database using `yarn db:migrate`.
6. Run the app locally using `yarn dev`.
   > This runs the client at `http://localhost:5173`, and the server at `http://localhost:4000`.
7. Open the web app on your desired browser using the URL above.
   > If you want to test out the server via the `GraphQL Explorer`, you can head over to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`

## ENV

These are the necessary environment variables that must be configured to run this application locally. You can check the `.env.example` on the respective machines for a quick breakdown of the environment variables.

> Note: All values are inferred as strings, and are parsed appropriately in the application. For example `Port` is a string value of 4000, it is parsed to its number counterpart in the application.
